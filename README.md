## Motivation

This project was designed to provide a solution to the difficulties the black-cab market currently face against overwhelming pressure from big-name ride hailing applications.

We have created an application built for both iOS and Android using Dart and Flutter, making use of the Google Maps API heat layer to depict the intensity of consumer footfall at geographical points in real time. This enables users to 'fine tune' their shifts, targetting unusually busy areas whilst avoiding quieter areas. This allows for greater accessibility of black cabs to the public while allowing users on the application to locate themselves in cost effective areas, minimising fuel consumption and unpaid time.

# Getting Started

1. Download and install Flutter to your respective operating system
2. Make sure all the packages are fetched. Run the `flutter pub get` command or open Pubspec.yaml and save.
3. Go to debug tab (in VS Code) and set configuration to Dart & Flutter. Ignore this for Android Studio.
4. Run application.
