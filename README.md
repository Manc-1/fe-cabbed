## Motivation

This project was designed to provide a solution to the difficulties the black-cab market currently face against overwhelming pressure from big-name ride hailing applications.

We have created an application built for both iOS and Android using Dart and Flutter, making use of the Google Maps API heat layer to depict the intensity of consumer footfall at geographical points in real time. This enables users to 'fine tune' their shifts, targetting unusually busy areas whilst avoiding quieter areas. This allows for greater accessibility of black cabs to the public while allowing users on the application to locate themselves in cost effective areas, minimising fuel consumption and unpaid time.
